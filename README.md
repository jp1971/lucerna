Lucerna
=======

A Vagrant box running a LAMP stack provisioned with Chef Solo. Special thanks to Mathias Hansen aka MiniCodeMonkey for his Vagrant LAMP Stack repo - https://github.com/MiniCodeMonkey/Vagrant-LAMP-Stack.

Documentation can be found [here](http://jp1971.com/2014/01/27/lucerna-a-vagrant-lamp-stack/)for now. I'll port it over to this README soon.
